## A Quantum Graph Hamiltonian Neural Network using Qiskit Patterns

This notebook accompanies my thesis and provides a complete implementation of the Quantum Graph Hamiltonian Neural Network (QGHNN) introduced by Wang et al (QGHNN, 2025). It demonstrates how graph‑structured data can be encoded into quantum states and serves as a practical reference for experimenting with Hamiltonian‑based quantum graph learning and extending QGHNN models to new tasks or datasets.

## Hamiltonian Simulation

Description: Ancilla-assisted simulation of Pauli-string Hamiltonians, demonstrating the construction of exact time-evolution operators using basis transformations and parity checks.

## Quantum Computing Module

Description: A collection of exercises and simulations inspired by textbooks and classical examples, focusing on fundamental quantum computing concepts and algorithms.

## Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) 

Description: A demonstration of how quantum circuits can generate truly random numbers using the inherent randomness of quantum states.
